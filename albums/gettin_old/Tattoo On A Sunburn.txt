It was the summer after my senior year
We spent the whole week out on that pier
She said, "Boy I think I love you," I said, "I love you, too"
We ended up drunk at some old ink shop
She said, "Get my name," I said, "Hell, why not?"
She didn't have to work too hard to talk me into
Ooh a tattoo on a sunburn

Every time that saltwater breeze blows in
I find myself laying right there in
A kicked back jet black leather seat
The hum and the buzz and the sting of that needle
Faded away but I guess some people never do
Losing you's the only thing worse
Than a tattoo on a sunburn

As I held her on her hotel balcony
I remember wishin' she would come back with me
Guess a boy can dream but we both knew it wouldn't work
When I came to she was already gone
Hammered down due west to Arkansas
And I laughed through the pain and swore it didn't hurt
Ooh a tattoo on a sunburn

Every time that saltwater breeze blows in
I find myself laying right there in
A kicked back jet black leather seat
The hum and the buzz and the sting of that needle
Faded away but I guess some people never do
Losing you's the only thing worse
Than a tattoo on a sunburn

It's covered up with some new ink now
And the rest the world ain't got a clue about
The name of a girl that I ain't seen since that day
I don't think about her all the time
But when they're stackin' the chairs right before the tide
I can still hear her voice come crashing down with the waves

Every time that saltwater breeze blows in
I find myself laying right there in
A kicked back jet black leather seat
The hum and the buzz and the sting of that needle
Faded away but I guess some people never do
Losing you's the only thing worse
Than a tattoo on a sunburn

A tattoo on a sunburn
