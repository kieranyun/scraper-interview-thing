I'm tired of looking over my shoulder
I'm tired of losing sleep all week long
Tired of the uneasy feeling and the sinful deceiving
No, my soul won't rest till he's gone

There's a fox in the henhouse
I can't seem to get him out
I'll hide in the shadows till the red rooster crows
Let that old twelve-gauge hammer come down

It's been going on a while now
It ain't hard to see all the signs
Fool me once, shame on me, but twice, then you'll see
That'll damn sure be the last time

There's a fox in the henhouse
I can't seem to get him out
I'll hide in the shadows till the red rooster crows
Let that old twelve-gauge hammer come down

There's a fox in the henhouse
I can't seem to get him out
I'll hide in the shadows till the red rooster crows
Let that old twelve-gauge hammer come down
Let that old twelve-gauge hammer come down
