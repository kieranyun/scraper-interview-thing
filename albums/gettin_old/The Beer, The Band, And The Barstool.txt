He walks in
Orders up a round
How you been?
My old friend

The band kicks off
The same old dance
The same old worn-out songs
But he sings along

He's gonna stay here 'til they make him leave
'Cause he's got all the friends a guy like him could ever need

One'll hang around and tell him what he wants to hear
One'll help by drownin' out the how'd you wind up here's
One'll hold him up when love has let him down
They do the best they can for a broken-hearted fool
The beer, the band, and the barstool

Corner booth
A blonde with lonely eyes
A shade of blue
Hey, how are you?

Just by chance
Are you here alone?
How 'bout a dance?
And she took his hand

He hopes she'd stay, but always knew she'd leave
But he's got all the friends a guy like him could ever need

One'll hang around and tell him what he wants to hear
One'll help by drownin' out the how'd you wind up here's
One'll hold him up when love has let him down
They do the best they can for a broken-hearted fool
The beer, the band, and the barstool

Now he last call lights a cigarette and orders up one more
Pays his tab, knows he'll be back, 'cause he's been here before

One'll hang around and tell him what he wants to hear
One'll help by drownin' out the how'd you wind up here's
One'll hold him up when love has let him down
They do the best they can for a broken-hearted fool
They go hand in hand with losing you
The beer, the band, and the barstool
And the barstool
