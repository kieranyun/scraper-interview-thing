I still hit them dive bars
Every once in a blue moon
Got a wild card
I keep inside my boot
I been thinkin' lately maybe I should save it
'Cause them hangovers sure kick my ass these days
So I spend most my happy hours here at home
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
And I've been finding peace of mind slowing my roll
You learn to tow that line with time as it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

It's when you start thinkin'
How much time left you got
If there's more sand
In the bottom or the top
'Cause that hourglass we have don't last forever
I've been thinkin' 'bout it more and more these days
It's like the less you have, the faster that it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
And I've been finding peace of mind slowing my roll
You learn to tow that line with time as it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

I'm still bending rules, but thinkin' 'fore I break 'em
And I ain't lost a step, I just look before I take 'em

But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
And I've been finding peace of mind slowing my roll
Learn to tow that line with time as it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old
