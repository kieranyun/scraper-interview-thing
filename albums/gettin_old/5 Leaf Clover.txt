I go to work every Monday
And get to do something I love
I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
I got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
And on the weekend it's full of good friends

I know I'm a lucky man
But I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves
The world in the palm of their hand
I've hit my knees thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
Is how'd a guy like me who'd a been fine with three
Wind up with five leaf clover?

I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
That my dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

I know I'm a lucky man
But I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves
The world in the palm of their hand
I've hit my knees thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
Is how'd a guy like me who'd a been fine with three
Wind up with a five leaf clover

I know I'm a lucky man
But I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves
The world in the palm of their hand
I've hit my knees thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
Is how'd a guy like me who'd a been fine with three
Wind up with a five leaf clover?

How'd a guy like me who coulda wound up with weeds
Wind up with a five leaf clover?
