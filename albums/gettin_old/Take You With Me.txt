Daddy, what's that mean, that little turtle and a rabbit?
He sat me in that seat, showed me the wheel and how to grab it
He said, "I'll work the pedals if you climb up on my knee, I'll take you with me"

A few years down the road, packin' a cooler and a sandwich
Clingin' to his leg, guess he could tell I couldn't stand it
He said, "Go hug your mama and I'll go grab my keys, I'll take you with me"

If it was up to me, we'd do everything together
And when you're young like that, you think those days last forever
Didn't know back then how much those words would mean
"I'll take you with me"

I remember one time me and him was turnin' wrenches
He kept a couple cold ones tucked away for when we fixed it
He said, "Let's sneak out back so your Mama doesn't see, I'll take you with me"

If it was up to me, we'd do everything together
And when you're young like that, you think those days last forever
Didn't know back then how much those words would mean
"I'll take you with me"

Got a youngin' of my own, he's too young to understand it
When he gets a little older, watching the stage where I'm standin'
He'll know it's about him when he hears me sing, "I'll take you with me"

If it was up to me, we'd do everything together
And when they're young like that, those days, they don't last forever
So, every chance I get, you best believe
I'll take you with me

I'll take you with me

I'll take you with me
