Sure as the north star shining
Sure as in spring the dogwoods bloom
Sure as the sunset sinking west before it falls
Like the leaves in autumn trees were made to do

I'm still falling for you girl, from the second that I saw you
My whole world stood still, after all this time
I'm just as in love as the day I made you mine
I ain't stopped flying high and never will, I'm falling for you still

Sweet as summer honeysuckle, true as the words written in red
Pretty as the daisies growing wild upon the hill
Like the rain that came from storm clouds overhead

I'm still falling for you girl, from the second that I saw you
My whole world stood still, after all this time
I'm just as in love as the day I made you mine
I ain't stopped flying high and never will, I'm falling for you still

I'm still falling for you girl, from the second that I saw you
My whole world stood still, after all this time
I'm just as in love as the day I made you mine
I ain't stopped flying high and never will, I'm falling for you still

Falling for you girl, from the second that I saw you
My whole world stood still, after all this time
I'm just as in love as the day I made you mine
I ain't stopped flying high and never will
I ain't stopped flying high and never will, I'm falling for you still

Falling for you still
