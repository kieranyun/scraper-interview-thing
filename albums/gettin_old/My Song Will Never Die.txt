There's a beat coming from somewhere other than my chest
There's words that stir up dust in the peace that I will rest
A melody to ease the mind long after I've lost mine
I will, but my song will never die

I don't know the day, I don't know the time
But one day, my Bonnie ain't gonna have her Clyde
And I know I'll be leaving somewhere further down the line
I will, but my song will never die

When I hear that hallelujah chorus calling me back home
I'll lay down this guitar and someone else can sing my songs
It ain't about the leaving, it's in what you leave behind
I will, but my song will never die

True words are rare birds, they heal up broken hearts
They sing through rusty strings on beat up, old guitars
The notes are always changing, but truth stands the test of time
I will, but my song will never die

When I hear that hallelujah chorus calling me back home
I'll lay down this guitar and someone else can sing my songs
It ain't about the leaving, it's in what you leave behind
I will, but my song will never die

When my name ain't nothing more than just letters on a stone
Or flowers in a field full of other sinners gone
It ain't about the leaving, it's in what you leave behind
I will, but my song will never die

I will, but my song will never die
I will, but my song will never die
I will, but my song will never die
I will, but my song will never die

When I hear that hallelujah chorus calling me back home
I'll lay down this guitar and someone else can sing my songs
It ain't about the leaving, it's in what you leave behind
I will, but my song will never die
Oh, I will, but my song will never die
