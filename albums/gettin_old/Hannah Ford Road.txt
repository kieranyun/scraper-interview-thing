Her daddy bought it in '95
He built a cabin at the end of the drive
And he named that gravel path after his pride and joy
I met Hannah when we was in school
She was hot as Alabama in June
Wasn't long before I was knockin' on her door

And we were goin' down Hannah Ford Road
Yeah, it always took us where we wanted to go
We couldn't wait any longer
And the feelin' couldn't get any stronger
Man, her daddy woulda killed me if he'd only known what was goin' on
Down Hannah Ford Road

Now Mr. Ford, he wasn't no fool
He kinda figured what we were up to
He said, "Hannah, I don't want you seein' that boy no more"
So I'd cut the lights a quarter mile out
She'd meet me 'tween there and the house
Like two thieves in the night in the light of the dashboard glow

We were goin' down Hannah Ford Road
Yeah, it always took us where we wanted to go
And we couldn't wait any longer
And the feelin' couldn't get any stronger
Man, her daddy woulda killed me if he'd only known what was goin' on
Down Hannah Ford Road

Now, there ain't a time
I drive by that sign that in my mind, I ain't

Goin' down Hannah Ford Road
Yeah, it always took us where we wanted to go
We couldn't wait any longer
And the feelin' couldn't get any stronger
Man, her daddy woulda killed me if he'd only known what was goin' on
Down Hannah Ford Road
