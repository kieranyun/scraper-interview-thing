Haggard on a houseboat, trying not to sink
Wonderin' if he oughta float back, or just stay here and drink
He found a guitar 'fore he found that Shasta shore
A song was born

Willie on an airplane, brown bag and a pen
Flying high thinking 'bout being on the road again
Tried her out on a crowd down at John T. Floore's
A song was born

Outta real life, outta real love
The best ones you can't make up
It just means more when you've been there before
Outta hard times, outta heartbreaks
Hitch a good rhyme to a mistake
Then you pour those feelings out over three chords
A song was born

I've wrote 'em in the Carolina mountains, on a Cabo beach
In a thousand rooms in Nashville, Tennessee
On a Bitterroot River, Montana back porch
A song was born

Outta real life, outta real love
The best ones you can't make up
It just means more when you've been there before
Outta hard times, outta heartbreaks
Hitch a good rhyme to a mistake
Then you pour those feelings out over three chords
A song was born

Outta real life, outta real love
The best ones you can't make up
It just means more when you've been there before
Outta hard times, outta heartbreaks
Hitch a good rhyme to a mistake
Then you pour those feelings out over three chords
Then you pour those feelings out over three chords
A song was born
