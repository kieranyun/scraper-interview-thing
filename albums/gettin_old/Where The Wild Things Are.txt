My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kicked-started that bike one night and broke Mama's heart
He pointed that headlight west
Out where the wild things are

He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
How he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, "Little brother, you'd love it out here
Out where the wild things are"

Oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in LA
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool
Out where the wild things are

Oh, yeah
Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back east
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

Oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, they said he hit that guardrail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are

Out where the wild things are
