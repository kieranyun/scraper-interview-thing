They say I walk just like ya
They say I talk just like ya
They say these scuffed up boots look as good on me as they did on you
And that bored out Ford you had is runnin' just as good as it ever has
I think I broke your record for a smallmouth bass
Sunset spinnerbait, second cast
I wonder what you'd think about that

If you walked in, pulled up a chair in your kitchen
Poured a little somethin' for some sippin' and said "Tell me 'bout all things that I've been missin'"
We'd be trashin' the price of gas and politicians
Put a hurtin' on an old Gibson
And I could tell you 'bout all the life that I've been livin'
I'd like to think I'd be the proudest guy in town
If I could see you see me now

You could say things turned out good
I met the girl that you said I would
Got a place on a piece of land
With a creek fed pond, and a food plot stand
I still use your cast iron skillet
Been makin' mama's corn bread in it
And I know your head would be spinnin'
If you saw this table refinished
I know right where we'd be sittin'

If you walked in, pulled up a chair in the kitchen
Poured a little somethin' for some sippin' and said "Tell me 'bout all things that I've been missin'"
We'd be trashin' the price of gas and politicians
Put a hurtin' on an old Gibson
And I could tell you 'bout all the life that I've been livin'
I'd like to think I'd be the proudest guy in town
If I could see you see me now

There'd be new old stories
And happy tears
Man I miss ya's
And a couple beers

If you walked in, pulled up a chair in your kitchen
Poured a little somethin' for some sippin' and said "Tell me 'bout all things that I've been missin'"
We'd be trashin' the price of gas and politicians
Put a hurtin' on an old Gibson
And I could tell you 'bout all the life that I've been livin'
I'd like to think I'd be the proudest guy in town
If I could see you see me now
See me now
