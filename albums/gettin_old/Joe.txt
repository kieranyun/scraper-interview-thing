I gotta job and my name's Joe
Spend my days at the Texaco
Never show up late
Never show up drunk
When I get half-lit, I'm a loaded gun
Made a couple wrong turns
Did county time
I do everything I can to stay between the lines

Gotta couple good buddies that all drop-in
Say "it's good to see ya brother, man how you been?"
I can't complain, I'm doin' alright, sleepin' pretty good, staying dry
Thank the Lord every mornin' with a sweet Amen for how far I've come from, how far I've been

So here's too good days, where I've been
So here's to good days, better tomorrows
And a light at the end of the bottle

Some battles are fought on foreign shores
Some are fought behind closed doors
Some fall from grace, some lose their wings
Some find the peace salvation brings

I Gotta couple good buddies that all drop-in
Say "it's good to see ya brother, man how you been?"
I can't complain, I'm doin' alright, sleepin' pretty good, staying dry
Thank the Lord every mornin' with a sweet Amen for how far I've come from, where I've been

So here's to good days, better tomorrows
And a light at the end of the bottle
Here's to good days, here's to livin'
Here's to old sins, being forgiven

And a couple good buddies that all drop-in
Say "it's good to see ya brother, man how you been?"
I can't complain, I'm doin' alright, sleepin' pretty good, staying dry
Thank the Lord every mornin' with a sweet Amen for how far I've come from, where I've been

So here's to good days, better tomorrows
And a light at the end of the bottle
At the end of the bottle
