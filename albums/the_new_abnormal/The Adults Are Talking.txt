Then I said
"You’re sophisticated"
Men complaining
Overeducated
They are bleeding
All their old excuses
Needs to wish and see
Now they’re in your way

Now I’m sitting
By the elevator
We can’t help it
If we are a problem
We are sick
Long in the faces
Climbing up your wall
Climbing up that wall

Don’t go there because you'll never return
And though you think of me when you think of him
Oh, yeah you don’t think wrong or rights to do
Because you said it now and you said it’s a joke
And then you did something wrong and you said it was right
And then you won’t look down and you never realize
And then I won’t look down 'cause you want me to
'Cause you want me do it the same as you

When I’m teaching
By the door I’m faded
Like Earth's quiet
Quiet strengths you made up
As they’re rising
On the streets you’re playing
Doing it for me
Doing it for me

And don't hold back 'cause you never look down
And then you think of me if you think of her
'Cause then you think you’re smart then we run from thoughts
And then you won’t let him see if it falls apart
And then we're falling out the door 'cause you’re never alone
And I don’t think of him when you’re so far gone
And you want me to do it just like you
You want me to do it the same as you

And I don't want anything
Unless it's you
Unless it's you
I don't want anyone
Unless that’s you
Unless that's
You
